/**
 * Bridge plugin that lets better-auth's `sessionMiddleware` accept the
 * RS256 JWT access tokens minted by our own oauthProvider plugin, instead
 * of only the HMAC-signed session tokens that the stock {@link bearer}
 * plugin understands.
 *
 * Use when:
 * - The same Hono app hosts both the OIDC IdP (oauthProvider) and the
 *   resource server (`/api/v1/*`, `/api/auth/*`). Stage-web / Electron /
 *   Pocket clients carry an OIDC JWT for everything; without this plugin
 *   their `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` is silently rejected by every
 *   `/api/auth/*` endpoint that needs `c.context.session`.
 *
 * Why a plugin (vs. per-route shims):
 * - The `before` hook fires before `sessionMiddleware`, so a single
 *   translation here lets every better-auth endpoint (current + future)
 *   accept JWTs. Per-route shims would have to be rewritten for each new
 *   endpoint we expose to OIDC clients.
 *
 * Architecture mismatch this paves over:
 * - better-auth's official OIDC story assumes the IdP and the resource
 *   server are different processes / different trust domains. The IdP
 *   issues JWTs for *external* RSes; the IdP itself only authenticates
 *   its own admin / profile API via cookies + HMAC bearer. Hosting both
 *   in one process is uncommon upstream, hence the gap.
 *
 * Mechanism:
 * 1. Detect a JWT-shaped Bearer token (3 base64url segments).
 * 2. Verify it via the local JWKS endpoint (the same RS256 keys our
 *    oauthProvider plugin signs with). If verification fails, bail out
 *    so the stock {@link bearer} plugin can still try its HMAC path.
 * 3. Mint a short-lived bridge `session` row (5 min TTL via the
 *    `override.expiresAt` parameter on `internalAdapter.createSession`).
 *    Reusing an existing OIDC-flow session would seem cheaper, but it
 *    would let a refreshed-after-sign-out JWT silently keep working
 *    until its own TTL — minting anew avoids that surprise.
 * 4. Sign the session token the same way better-auth's bearer plugin
 *    does (`serializeSignedCookie('', token, secret)` then strip the `=`),
 *    inject it as the `better-auth.session_token` cookie on the request
 *    headers, and let `sessionMiddleware` resolve from there as if a
 *    real cookie had been sent.
 *
 * NOTICE:
 * - We intentionally only run on JWT-shaped tokens. HMAC tokens (no `.`s
 *   in the obvious places, or fail JWKS verify) are passed through to
 *   the stock {@link bearer} plugin so the existing better-auth-only
 *   clients keep working.
 * - The bridge session table grows by one row per JWT-authed `/api/auth/*`
 *   request. With a 5-minute TTL the steady-state size is bounded; if
 *   that becomes load-bearing we can swap in a per-jti cache.
 * - Mirror of `bearer()`'s cookie injection trick:
 *   node_modules/better-auth/dist/plugins/bearer/index.mjs L26-58.
 *   Removal condition: better-auth ships a first-party way to verify
 *   externally-signed JWTs against a JWKS for its own session resolution.
