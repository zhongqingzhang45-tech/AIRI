## WebSocket Bridge

Stage Pocket adds a host-backed WebSocket bridge for `@proj-airi/server-sdk`.

Design constraints:
- keep page loading on secure origins (`https` or app-hosted local origins) to preserve secure-context web APIs
- only implement the WebSocket bridge needed by `@proj-airi/server-sdk`
- native owns socket I/O; `server-sdk` owns reconnect, heartbeat, authentication, and connection state
- the bridge only forwards `connect`, `send`, `close`, `open`, `message`, `error`, and `close`
