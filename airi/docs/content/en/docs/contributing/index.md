## If you have already contributed to this project before

::: warning

If you haven't clone this repository, skip this section.

:::

Make sure your local repository is up to date with the upstream repository:

```shell
git fetch --all
git checkout main
git pull upstream main --rebase
```

If you have a working branch, to make your branch up to date with the upstream repository:

```shell
git checkout <your-branch-name>
git rebase main
```

## Fork this project

Click on the **Fork** button on the top right corner of the [moeru-ai/airi](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi) page.

## Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/airi.git
cd airi
```

## Create your working branch

```shell
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

## Install dependencies

```shell
corepack enable
pnpm install

# For Rust dependencies
# Not required if you are not going to develop on either crates or apps/tamagotchi
cargo fetch
```

::: tip

We would recommend to install [@antfu/ni](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) to make your script simpler.

```shell
corepack enable
npm i -g @antfu/ni
```

Once installed, you can

- use `ni` for `pnpm install`, `npm install` and `yarn install`.
- use `nr` for `pnpm run`, `npm run` and `yarn run`.

You don't need to care about the package manager, `ni` will help you choose the right one.

:::

::: tip

If you have [@antfu/ni](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni) installed, you can use `nr` to run the commands:

```shell
nr lint && nr typecheck
```

:::

### Commit

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"
```

### Push to your fork repository

```shell
git push origin <your-branch-name> -u
```

You should be able to browse the branch on your fork repository.

::: tip

If this is your first time contributing with this project, you need to add the upstream repository too:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi.git
