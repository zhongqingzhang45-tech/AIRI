# Vendored Add-on Local Patches

This project vendors Godot add-ons under `addons/` because Godot plugins are
installed as project-local source and asset folders. Keep this file in sync
whenever vendored add-on files differ from their upstream source.

## Upstream Baselines

- `addons/vrm`

## Source Patches

### `addons/vrm/vrm_extension.gd`

- Local change: use `root_node.get_node_or_null("secondary")` instead of
  `root_node.get_node("secondary")`.
- Reason: some VRM 0.0 exporters include `secondaryAnimation` data without a
  scene node named `secondary`. The upstream `get_node()` call throws before
  the existing null fallback can create the node.
- Validation: comparing vendored source files against upstream commit
  `651205484c35f5cd7ba56475ff636e10db8ad674` shows this as the only changed
  `.gd`/`.shader`/`.cfg`/`.cs` file under `addons/`. Runtime import then
  completes without the `Node not found: "secondary"` importer error.
- Removal condition: remove this patch after the upstream add-on ships the same
  lookup fix or otherwise handles missing `secondary` nodes before parsing
  spring bones.

### MToon ambient and cutout shader patch

Files:

- `addons/Godot-MToon-Shader/mtoon_common.gdshaderinc`
- `addons/Godot-MToon-Shader/mtoon_cutout.gdshader`
- `addons/Godot-MToon-Shader/mtoon_cutout_cull_off.gdshader`
- `addons/Godot-MToon-Shader/mtoon_outline_cutout.gdshader`

- Local change: enable `render_mode ambient_light_disabled` for the shared MToon
  shader include.
- Local change: route MToon cutout materials through Godot's alpha scissor
  antialiasing path by writing `ALPHA`, setting `ALPHA_SCISSOR_THRESHOLD`,
  `ALPHA_ANTIALIASING_EDGE`, and `ALPHA_TEXTURE_COORDINATE`, and enabling
  `render_mode alpha_to_coverage`.
- Reason: AIRI's stage preset owns sky, ground, and environment presentation, but
  avatar toon materials need stable character color. Godot's default ambient
  light and radiance contribution can wash out MToon avatars as the stage
  environment changes, so AIRI isolates avatar MToon materials from implicit
  WorldEnvironment ambient while keeping direct light handling in the shader.
- Reason: VRM hair, lashes, accessories, and outline cutout passes use hard alpha
  edges. At distance, those edges collapse into visible stair-step or dashed
  pixels. Godot's alpha-to-coverage path works with 3D MSAA, and Godot's shader
  alpha scissor path requires `ALPHA` to receive the sampled texture alpha.
  Writing `ALPHA` may route these shaders through Godot's transparent pipeline,
  which can introduce sorting or shadow-casting regressions. AIRI accepts that
  tradeoff for the current visual baseline and should revisit it if those
  regressions appear or upstream exposes a cutout antialiasing path that
  preserves opaque shadow semantics.
- Validation: `tests/material-rendering-check/materialRenderingCheck.tscn`
  imports AvatarSample A/B and still detects MToon, cutout, transparent,
  outline, and shadow-caster materials after the patch.
- Removal condition: remove this patch if AIRI moves to an owned MToon shader
  variant, or if upstream exposes a supported way to opt MToon materials out of
  Godot environment ambient/radiance while preserving VRM import compatibility.

## Generated Metadata Differences

These files differ from the upstream commit after opening/importing the add-on
with Godot `4.6.2`. They are not AIRI behavior patches, but they are recorded so
future add-on upgrades can distinguish generated metadata churn from intentional
source changes.

### SVG Import Metadata

- `addons/vrm/node_constraint/icons/bone_node_constraint.svg.import`
- `addons/vrm/node_constraint/icons/bone_node_constraint_applier.svg.import`

Observed difference:

- Godot `4.6.2` adds current texture import fields such as
  `compress/uastc_level`, `compress/rdo_quality_loss`, and
  `process/channel_remap/*`.

### Godot UID Sidecars

Godot generated `.uid` sidecar files under:

- `addons/vrm/**/*.uid`
- `addons/Godot-MToon-Shader/**/*.uid`

These preserve Godot resource UIDs for imported scripts and shader resources.
They are local generated metadata, not source patches.

## Upgrade Checklist

When updating the vendored add-ons:

1. Compare the new upstream add-on against the current vendored tree.
2. Re-apply source patches listed above only if the upstream fix is still absent.
3. Let Godot regenerate import metadata and `.uid` sidecars if needed.
4. Update this file with the new upstream commit and the remaining local patch
   list.
