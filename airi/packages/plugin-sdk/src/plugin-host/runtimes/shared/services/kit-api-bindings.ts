/**
 * Stores the host's canonical binding records for dynamically contributed kit instances.
 *
 * Use when:
 * - A plugin contributes runtime instances through higher-level kit APIs
 * - The host needs an ownership-aware registry that tracks lifecycle and config for those instances
 * - Adapters, permission checks, and debug tooling need one authoritative binding table
 *
 * Expects:
 * - Callers treat a binding as the low-level host record behind a higher-level contribution API
 * - Kits define the meaning of `kitModuleType` and validate kit-specific config outside this service
 * - Binding ids stay unique per owner and are reused intentionally, not accidentally
 *
 * Returns:
 * - Stable {@link BindingRecord} snapshots representing bound runtime contributions
 *
 * A binding is the concrete link between a extension-owned runtime instance and a host-registered kit.
 * The host keeps kits generic: a kit only describes capabilities, supported runtimes, and allowed
 * operations. That is not enough to render UI, route lifecycle, or enforce ownership for a specific
 * plugin contribution. The missing piece is a binding record saying:
 *
 * - extension session `X` owns runtime instance `moduleId`
 * - that instance is attached to kit `kitId`
 * - within that kit it behaves as subtype `kitModuleType`
 * - here is its current generic config payload and lifecycle state
 *
 * Why kits require bindings:
 *
 * - Multiple plugins can use the same kit at the same time, so the host needs per-instance records.
 * - Permission checks are kit-scoped, but ownership and lifecycle are instance-scoped.
 * - Surface adapters need something concrete to mount, update, degrade, or withdraw.
 *
 * Higher-level kit APIs should normally sit on top of this service instead of exposing it directly.
 * For example, a future `createWidgetApi(ctx)` could call `bind(...)`, `activate(...)`, and `update(...)`
 * internally while presenting a simpler `register('widget-1')` API to plugin authors. In that model:
 *
 * - kits define the contract
 * - bindings persist concrete instances of that contract
 * - adapters consume binding records to produce UI/runtime behavior
 *
 * This is similar to VS Code's contribution system in spirit, but not in exact mechanics. VS Code uses
 * declarative contribution points in extension manifests and the host interprets them at load time. AIRI's
 * binding registry is more runtime-oriented:
 *
 * - contributions can appear after startup
 * - they can transition through host-managed lifecycle states
 * - they are session-owned and can be withdrawn or rebound on reload
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * 1. One plugin binds once:
 *    - before: `{}`
 *    - `bind({ moduleId: 'widget-main', kitId: 'kit.widget', kitModuleType: 'window', ... })`
 *    - after: `{ 'widget-main' => { state: 'announced', revision: 1, ... } }`
 *
 * 2. The same plugin binds the same id again:
 *    - before: `{ 'widget-main' => { state: 'announced', revision: 1, runtime: 'electron' } }`
 *    - `bind(...)` with the same owner but different config
 *    - after: unchanged record is returned. This preserves idempotency and prevents silent mutation during rebind.
 *
 * 3. Another plugin tries to bind the same id:
 *    - before: `{ 'widget-main' => owned by session-a/plugin-a }`
 *    - `bind(...)` from session-b/plugin-b
 *    - after: throws collision error, registry remains unchanged
 *
 * 4. One plugin binds many times under one kit:
 *    - `widget-main`, `widget-sidebar`, `widget-dialog`
 *    - after: three binding records, all under `kit.widget`, each with independent lifecycle and config
 *
 * 5. One plugin binds across multiple kits:
 *    - `chat-sidebar` under `kit.chat`
 *    - `widget-main` under `kit.widget`
 *    - after: one registry, multiple kit families, each record still resolved by the same ownership rules
